Delay The Inevitable

Ideas
- Doomsday is coming
- You can delay it and manipulate odds in your favour
- By doing that, you can prevent your death and/or get different endings/scores?
- You're given a deck of cards
- After going through all cards, a cosmic horror is going to tear the world apart
- You can go through all cards in sequence, but that will only make the game end faster and with a bad endings
- You can manipulate cards or even make more appear depending on circunstances, but doing so makes them harder
- Cards mean an action sequence you have to complete (or maybe a mini game?)
- Cards can also give resources that may allow you to bargain for your soul
- Something like a "cultist simulator" in the sense you have to figure out what to do

A deck starts with 10 cards? 
(the game should show you that you can finish it with the lowest score if you just follow the most obvious instructions)

Types of cards?
- Sacrifices (requires people around you?)
- Rituals (requires objects)
- Prayers
- Circles

Cards have rewards
- They may have invitations (brings people to the table)
- They may have ritual objects (resource)
- They may give you more cards
- They may have specific rewards (goals)

Cards are drawn one by one (?)

Actions
You have 5 seconds to take an action:

You can either play, burn, or delay a card.
You can choose to play a card whether or not meet its requirements, and then:
	- If you execute it correctly, you gain its positive outcome
	- If you fail it, you gain its negative outcome
You can burn cards to get rid of a negative outcome, by consuming a ritual object.
You can delay cards any time you want, but by doing so they will get stronger the next time they come. Cards can be delayed 2 times (?)
If you do nothing, the card will be destroyed permanently.
 
Artifacts
- It's what you use when you play cards.
You start with "Clap" (space-bar) and with "Chalk" (mouse)
So you can do prayers and rituals that require clapping
Or draw circles.

You gain artifacts by doing stuff in the game
Example: After 5 successful prayers, you learn to "Bow" (b button)
Then you can play cards that require you to bow, enabling more options.
